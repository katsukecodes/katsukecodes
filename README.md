## Hi, I'm Katsuke 👋

Full-stack engineer | ECE trainee | Building of useful things

I explore the intersection of software, hardware, and intelligent systems. Whether it's crafting clean and scalable applications, tinkering with embedded systems, or experimenting with AI-driven workflows, I love building things that work.

### What I Do

Full-stack development – building modern, scalable web \ mobile apps

Embedded & hardware tinkering – microcontrollers, sensors, automation

AI & intelligent systems – integrating ML tools into real-world projects

Systems design – focusing on reliability, clarity, and simplicity
